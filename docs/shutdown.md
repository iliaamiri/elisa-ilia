### Step 1 - Open Command Prompt

You just need to get into the search bar and search `cmd`. If you're unsure how to open your command prompt, refer back to [opening CMD](https://iliaamiri.github.io/elisa-ilia/docs/navigateThroughFilesystem/#searching-and-opening-cmd-using-windows-search).

### Step 2 - Type in Desired Commands

Type into terminal with desired commands and press `enter`: 

`shutdown -r` to **restart**
`shutdown -s` to **shutdown**

>> **Note**: If you want to have a delay in shutdown or restart you can type your command `shutdown /r -t 60`. The `-t 60` is to tell the computer to restart in *60 seconds*.
