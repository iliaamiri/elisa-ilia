## History of Windows

Windows, also known as Microsoft Windows and Windows OS, was first released in 1985 as an extension from Microsoft's existing disk operating system called MS-DOS. 

This was a huge change for Microsoft because Windows provided a virtual desktop for users, which allowed a GUI(Graphical User Interface) in comparasion to typing commands and directory paths.

## Why Learn Windows?
Interestingly, Windows Server Operation System family was the dominating server. A research expert, Thomas Alsop, said that Windows "was used on 72.1 percent of servers worldwide," which implies that this Operation System standed out recently.

For an super user, it is necessary to be familiar with the common basic commands of an Operation System. Since a Linux user, at some point, had to use a Command-line Interface (CLI), learning Windows' CLI commands will be a fast learning curve.
